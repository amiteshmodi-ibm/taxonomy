  - context: About foundation models
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is a foundation model?
        answer: >-
          A foundation model is an AI model trained on broad data at scale such
          that it can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.
      - question: What were Granite's first foundation models?
        answer: >-
          Granite's first foundation models were Granite.13b.instruct and
          Granite.13b.chat.
      - question: 'What is 13b in Granite.13b.instruct '
        answer: >-
          The "13b" in their name comes from 13 billion, the amount of
          parameters they have as models, lesser than most of the larger models
          of the time.
